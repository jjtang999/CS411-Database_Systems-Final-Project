# Project Proposal
## Title:  UIUC Course Explorer 2.0
## Project Summary
Our project aims to provide a webpage full of more detailed information students can use when deciding to register for (or just generally examine) courses here at the university. We aim to provide detailed information on the professors, gpa’s, and times for many courses here at the university. We will also include information about courses that satisfy general education requirements. Students will be able to use our webpage to do in depth analysis on the classes they want to take.

If a student is struggling to fill a general education requirement, they could use our application to search for classes that satisfy their requirements. After finding a list of suitable courses, they can investigate information relating to the professor, including average GPA given for the course (and in general). They can also look at interesting correlations within the course data, such as how course start time and professor’s salary affects the average GPA.

## Description
Our application will be a web application that has two main parts, a course selection interface and a professor interface. The course interface will have a main table for listing courses and it will provide methods to filter and sort courses by attributes such as average GPA, start time, general education requirements, and term offered. There will also be a way to view all the information about a specific course in the list. The professor interface will provide similar functionality. Users will be able to filter and sort the list of professors by attributes like department, salary, and average GPA given. The user can also choose to select a professor individually to find out more about them.

The application will also provide an interface for updating the database. This is important for when new courses are added or information on the professors changes. All CRUD functionality will be available for the courses and the professors.


## Usefulness

## Realness

## Functionality

Our project will provide four major units of functionality: A course search menu, an in-depth course information space, a professor search menu, and an in-depth professor information space. The course search menu will have search functionality for name and number, and filter options for general education requirements, department, term, days of the week, and subject.
There will aslo be sort options for average GPA, number, start time, and end time.
The in-depth course information space will allow users to view all times the course has been offered, professors that have taught the course, and GPA statistics for each offering.

The professor search menu will have search functionality for name, and filter options for college, and department. There will also be sort options for salary, average GPA given, and number of students taught.
The in-depth professor information space will allow users to view courses the professor taught, GPA data for each course taught, and the professor's salary.


There will also be interfaces for performing CRUD operations on the professor and course information.
